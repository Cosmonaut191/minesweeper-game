## Games Included

This project includes the following games:

### Minesweeper
- **Objective**: Clear a grid of hidden mines without detonating any.
- **Gameplay**: Click on squares to reveal them. If you reveal a mine, the game is over. Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that square. Use this information to deduce where mines are located.

### Snake
- **Objective**: Control a snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with the walls or itself.
- **Gameplay**: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls.

### Tic Tac Toe
- **Objective**: Get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- **Gameplay**: Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks wins the game.

Enjoy playing!
